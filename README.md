The WinMerge 2011 series is a fork of the original WinMerge application published on SourceForge by Thingamahoochie Software. It was an escape from the [complex situation](http://forums.winmerge.org/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=352&start=10#p1384) that existed with respect to WinMerge 2.x at that time. ATL/MFC dependencies have been removed to support building with Visual C++ Express editions. Thanks to the advent of Visual Studio Community, the move away from ATL/MFC lost some of its point, although I think it does at least represent sort of a cleanup which the codebase sort of demanded for. Anyhow, winmerge.org finally recovered from said complex situation by making Takashi's fork official, and that is extraordinarily cool.
