WINMERGE

WinMerge is an Open Source comparing and merging tool for Windows. WinMerge can
compare both folders and files, presenting differences in a visual text format
that is easy to understand and handle. WinMerge can be used as an external
differencing/merging tool or as a standalone application.

WinMerge has many helpful supporting features to make comparing, synchronising,
and merging as easy and useful as possible. Several programming languages and
other file formats are syntax-highlighted.

WinMerge 2011 was forked from WinMerge at some time in the past, after years of
paralysis. Around 2017/18, WinMerge has seen a restart based on Takashi's fork.
