 * There are two kinds of diffs:
 * - significant diffs are 'normal' diffs we want to merge and browse
 * - non-significant diffs are diffs ignored by linefilters
 * 
 * The code assumes diff lists don't grow bigger than 32-bit int type's
 * range. And what a trouble we'd have if we have so many diffs...
