/** @var CMP_CONTENT
 * @brief Normal by content compare.
 * This compare type is first, default and all-seeing compare type.
 * diffutils is used for producing compare results. So all limitations
 * of diffutils (like buffering) apply to this compare method. But this
 * is also currently only compare method that produces difference lists
 * we can use in file compare.
 */

/** @var CMP_QUICK_CONTENT
 * @brief Faster byte per byte -compare.
 * This type of compare was a response for needing faster compare results
 * in folder compare. It independent from diffutils, and fully customised
 * for WinMerge. It basically does byte-per-byte compare, still implementing
 * different whitespace ignore options.
 *
 * Optionally this compare type can be stopped when first difference is found.
 * Which gets compare as fast as possible. But misses sometimes binary files
 * if zero bytes aren't found before first difference. Also difference counts
 * are not useful with that option.
 */

/** @var CMP_DATE
 * @brief Compare by modified date.
 * This compare type was added after requests and realization that in some
 * situations difference in file's timestamps is enough to judge them
 * different. E.g. when modifying files in local machine, file timestamps
 * are certainly different after modifying them. This method doesn't even
 * open files for reading them. It only reads file's infos for timestamps
 * and compares them.
 *
 * This is no doubt fastest way to compare files.
 */

/** @var CMP_DATE_SIZE
 * @brief Compare by date and then by size.
 * This method is basically same than CMP_DATE, but it adds check for file
 * sizes if timestamps are identical. This is because there are situations
 * timestamps can't be trusted alone, especially with network shares. Adding
 * checking for file sizes adds some more reliability for results with
 * minimal increase in compare time.
 */

/** @var CMP_SIZE
 * @brief Compare by file size.
 * This compare method compares file sizes. This isn't quite accurate method,
 * other than it can detect files that certainly differ. But it can show lot of
 * different files as identical too. Advantage is in some use cases where different
 * size always means files are different. E.g. automatically created logs - when
 * more data is added size increases.
