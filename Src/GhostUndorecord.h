/**
 * @brief Support For Descriptions On Undo/Redo Actions.
 *
 * We need a structure to remember richer information position
 * and the number of real lines inserted/deleted (to set ghost lines during undo)
 *
 * This flags are parameters of AddUndoRecord ; so AddUndoRecord
 * is not the virtual version of CCrystalTextBuffer::AddUndoRecord
 *
 * The text is duplicated (already in CCrystalTextBuffer::SUndoRecord),
 * and it is not useful. If someone finds a clean way to correct this...
